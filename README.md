# üé¨ Netflix Data Analysis & Database Design üé•

Welcome to the **Netflix Data Analysis & Database Normalization** project! This project explores the process of cleaning, normalizing, and analyzing Netflix data using SQL and database best practices. It also dives into database design principles to ensure optimized data storage and retrieval.

## üìë Project Overview

The original dataset contained two key tables:
- **`titles`**: Information on unique shows and movies.
- **`credits`**: Details on the cast and crew involved in each show or movie.

### Problem
We discovered discrepancies between the two tables:
- The **`credits`** table contained more unique show IDs than the **`titles`** table, leading to inconsistencies.
  
### Solution
We created a unified view by selecting only the common records from both tables, ensuring data consistency throughout the analysis. Afterward, we applied **database normalization** techniques to split the data into smaller, well-organized tables.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Design & Normalization

### Key Benefits:
1. **Less Data Duplication**: Improved storage efficiency by reducing redundancy.
2. **Increased Data Integrity**: Accurate and consistent data across all tables.
3. **Improved Query Performance**: Faster and more efficient queries through proper indexing and structure.
4. **Enhanced Security**: More controlled access to sensitive information.

### Process Overview:
1. **Conceptual Data Model**: High-level view of key entities and relationships.

## üîç Data Analysis Highlights

### Insights:
- We performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in popular genres, actor appearances, and the distribution of shows across different ratings.
- The normalized tables made it easy to run complex queries on specific data points, providing deeper insights into Netflix's vast content library.

### Queries:
Some of the SQL queries we explored:
- **Most Frequent Actors**: Identify which actors appear most often in Netflix shows.
- **Genre Popularity**: Analyze which genres dominate Netflix‚Äôs catalog.
- **Rating Distributions**: Understand how shows and movies are rated across various regions.

### Visualization:
We used tools like **Tableau** and **Power BI** to visualize the findings. Here's an example of how the data looks post-normalization:

## üí° Why Normalize Your Database?

Normalization is crucial for:
- Ensuring **data consistency** across related tables.
- **Eliminating redundancy**, so each piece of data is stored only once.
- Making your database **scalable**, easier to manage, and more flexible for future changes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Python** (for additional data analysis)
- **Tableau/Power BI** (for visualizations)

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository** to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
